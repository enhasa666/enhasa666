For the latter case, I even witnessed that happen at work when I was still employed at some cheapskate marketing company.</p><h2>The fix</h2><p>Jesus Christ. Just get a fucking SSD.</p><p>Whether you are on a laptop or a desktop, or whether you have a spare drive slot or not, there is simply no excuse for not having an SSD installed.</p><p>240GB SSDs are fucking cheap. If you’re on a laptop and you need large storage capacities, external hard drive enclosures are also fucking cheap – just slap your laptop’s old hard drive in there and you’re good to go. Stop wasting your time waiting for Windows to “start being ready to launch apps”. Stop wasting your time waiting for the <em>Downloads</em> folder to complete listing its contents. Stop wasting your time trying to figure out why the fuck your laptop is running extremely hot, even though you have reinstalled Windows a fuck-ton of times and are absolutely sure you’re not running any bloatware whatsoever.</p><p>Online guides will tell you to turn off all visual effects, run disk cleanup, defragment, disable startup programs, turn off Cortana and search indexing, and all sorts of bullshit. Those won’t do jack, because (a) your problem is not the lack of processing power, and (b) these services don’t gobble up disk usage as much as you’d think.</p><p>Even if you’re rocking an i69s-6969K your anemic hard drive will hold you back. The CPU simply can’t do shit if it can’t get the data off your hard drive. No OS reinstall will fix that.</p><p>240GB SSDs are 25 USD. How much is your time worth, really? Is your time really worth being spent on following some guy’s tutorial on the internet, whose sole motivation “to help you” is ad revenue from the ads and trackers peppered across his site?</p><p>Give it a shot. Get an SSD and install it yourself or have someone do it for you. Bam. Problems solved.</p><h2>Spreading the word</h2><p>Let’s assume that someone actually came into my blog, read this post, and changed his mind and got himself an SSD. He’s probably so stoked about how much a small credit card-sized thing fixed all his problems with his computer that he wants to tell all his friends about it. He’d want to preach the word of the SSD, and how it will save us from the evil productivity killer called the mechanical hard drive.</p><p>If you’re someone like the above hypothetical guy, I’m going to tell you straight away that there is no point trying to get people to switch to SSDs. They simply won’t care – even if they do, it’s extremely hard to quantify the performance gains of an SSD. It’s not like this is a processor where you can give it a core count or a clock speed to compare speeds with – storage options are being discussed in terms of capacity and not much else. Ah yes, capacity – good luck getting past the “capacity downgrade” argument that is always raised during these conversations.</p><p>So unless you’re head of IT or a tech-savvy business operations manager who gives a shit about office productivity, just shut it and enjoy watching other people struggle getting shit done on HDDs.</p><p>You’re not changing anyone’s minds. Hell, even performance comparisons between SSDs and HDDs on YouTube have been received positively only by those already on SSDs. The results have been completely ignored by those “smart enough not to buy something overpriced that holds much fewer data”.</p><p>Much like everything else, storage capacity discussions are avenue for dick-measuring contests. By going with SSDs, you’ll have the smaller dick, and nobody really wants that - even if you’re able to thrust magnitudes faster than the other bros.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 25, 2019</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://enhasa666.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://enhasa666.github.io/how-to-start-a-blog.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How to Start A Blog</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://enhasa666.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
