Races involve players competing in point-to-point time trial races across various terrain and weather conditions.</p><p>One of Dirt Rally’s key distinguishing features from other games in it’s genre is its brutal difficulty. Not only does it throw you off the road whenever it can, it also forces you to reassess your dreams and aspirations. It will make you realize that no matter how passionate you are about something, if it’s not for you, then you will never be good at it no matter how hard you try.</p><p><strong>Step one to become a better Dirt Rally player is acceptance. </strong>You must be willing to accept that putting in hundreds of Steam hours into this game will not necessarily make you better better than those with mere double digit playtimes. In fact, the hours you have played might not even be directly proportional to your skill level at all – at best you’ll only get better at listening to your co-driver or keeping the car pointing in the right direction.</p><p>I would argue that putting in time to practice does not improve your skill level whatsoever. It only brings you closer to the limit of your capabilities, which is still paltry compared to those meant to be good at the game.</p><p>Once you have mastered the notes and car control, you will still be 20 seconds behind per sector.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Accept that you will never become a rally driver.</strong></p><p>One could argue that with a better feel for the vehicle, stage times could be improved in real life versus the simulations offered by Dirt Rally.</p><p>Newsflash: rally drivers have played the game and can easily beat 99.99% of the Dirt Rally community. It’s just as much as having the instincts and concentration for rallying as it is for having a feel for the vehicle. </p><p>If you’re playing Dirt Rally to hopefully become the next rallying superstar, forget it. Either you have the skill or you don’t. 300 hours of Steam play time will not change that, nor will a kickass FFB setup in your living room.</p><p>So skip the expensive shit and play with a controller – you’re destined for the couch, not a rally car’s bucket seat.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Understand and listen to the notes.</strong></p><p>With fulll acceptance of lifelong mediocrity, you can now concentrate on actually listening to the notes and painting a mental picture of the road ahead.</p><p>Go slow along the course. Think of the pace notes as a checklist, mentally marking them as complete once you pass through them.</p><p>If you encounter a note that you are unfamiliar with, write it down and Google it later. Or you can infer them the moment you come across them again.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Concentrate</strong></p><p>Keep your mind off of other things.</p><p>The girl you like will not like you back and might never even notice you. You will never climb up the corporate ladder – you don’t have the necessary mental, social, and emotional skills to get past being an easily replaceable cog in the machine. And starting a business? Psh. Only you think your business idea is great. You’re not even the entrepreneur type. Also your family thinks you’re a good-for-nothing idiot they wish they weren’t associated with.</p><p>Now stop thinking about those truths and focus on the notes and the road. You need every ounce of mental energy to keep visualizing the road ahead – fail to paint one corner and you'll crash.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Just keep playing</strong></p><p>Don’t get me wrong – your skill level will only plateau past 100+ hours, so don’t think of this as practice.</p><p>Instead, play the game because:</p><ol><li><p>It helps you keep reality at bay by forcing you to concentrate on the stage – you’ll at least have 3 – 7 minutes of internal bliss. How much existential torment you suffer in between depends on how fast your computer can load stages</p></li><li><p>You’re really not fit for anything else. Your friends and family (if you had either) will tell you to make productive use of your free time, but we both know we’re better off not heeding this advice. Putting in effort into an endeavour only ruins something or drains time and money. At least with Dirt Rally it’s just time.</p></li></ol><p>With a bit of time and patience you’ll get better at accepting your lowly place in world and your unimportance in the grand scheme of things. These will help you shave a few seconds off your best times and hopefully make gameplay a lot less painful.</p><p>Now get racing!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 28, 2019</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://enhasa666.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://enhasa666.github.io/speeding-up-windows-10.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Speeding Up Windows 10</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://enhasa666.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
